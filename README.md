# Spaceship
I used python3.7 to finish the project. All libs I used are built-in in python, including tkinter, time, random

In my game, there will be a few obstacles(black balls) flying all over the game screen randomly. Control the spaceship(an rectangle) with left and right on keyboard to dodge the obstacles. Once the spaceship hits the obstacles, there will be a new window shows "Game Over!" and the time you survive.
